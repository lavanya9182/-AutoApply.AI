# Projects

## Smart Mirror – National Hackathon (Prajwalan2k25 Winner)
Collaboratively developed a hardware-based smart mirror integrated with a monitor to display yoga poses. Connected to a web application built with Streamlit. Deployed three deep learning models to ensure accurate yoga posture correction, eliminating the need for a trainer.  
The project won 1st prize at Prajwalan2k25 (National Level Hackathon). During evaluation, we quickly implemented major UI and usability enhancements requested by judges.  
The system used Raspberry Pi and multiple IoT components, blending hardware-software interaction for real-time guidance.

## Image Captioning – ML Intern at IIDT Blakbucks (APSCHE)
Built a caption generation pipeline using **CNN + LSTM** architecture to auto-describe uploaded images.  
Enhanced accessibility for visually impaired users and streamlined metadata generation for image datasets.

---

## Chatbot with ASR/TTS & RAG – LLM Workshop
Developed a chatbot integrating **Bhashini’s ASR/TTS** models and **RAG-based knowledge retrieval**.  
Used HuggingFace transformers, Google Gemini API, and custom prompts to create domain-specific assistants.

---

## Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection (CNN)
Developed a CNN model to analyze fingerprint images and predict the blood group of the individual.  
Focused on pattern recognition and biometric analysis.  
This project utilized OpenCV, Keras, and custom-trained CNN layers.

---

## Phishing Website Detection (Google Search Extension)
Created a Chrome extension that flags phishing websites directly within Google Search results.  
Trained a classifier using 50+ features extracted from URLs (e.g., HTTPS usage, domain age, JavaScript injection patterns).  
Integrated with real-time browsing to display warnings and improve user safety.

# Additional Projects – Fullstack & DevOps

## Fullstack: Student Feedback Portal  
Developed a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application for students to submit and view feedback on faculty.  
Implemented role-based login (student, faculty, admin), analytics dashboards, and JWT-based security.

## Fullstack: AI Resume Ranker  
Built a fullstack app using React + Flask where users upload resumes and job descriptions.  
The backend uses NLP models to rank and score resumes based on match with the job role.

## Fullstack: Social Media App Clone  
Cloned core features of Instagram using React, Firebase, and TailwindCSS.  
Features: posts, likes, comments, profile pages, and real-time notifications.

## DevOps: CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins & GitHub Actions  
Implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment stages for a Spring Boot app.  
Used GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins, and deployed to AWS EC2.

## DevOps: Infrastructure Automation using Terraform  
Used Terraform to provision AWS resources (EC2, S3, RDS) for a web application.  
Managed infrastructure as code with version control and repeatable deployments.

## DevOps: Kubernetes-Based Deployment with Helm  
Containerized a Flask-based ML app and deployed it on Kubernetes using Helm charts.  
Included auto-scaling, ingress rules, and resource monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana.
